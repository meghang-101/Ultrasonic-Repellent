# Ultrasonic-Repellent
Eagle Cad Design with Gerber Files

The [Schematic](https://github.com/meghang-101/Ultrasonic-Repellent/blob/main/20-12-2020-10pm.pdf) has the Schematic Representation of the Circuit connections including the Ultrasonic Repellent and the Battery Indicator

The [Eagle Schematic](https://github.com/meghang-101/Ultrasonic-Repellent/blob/main/20-12-2020-10pm.sch) and the [Eagle Board](https://github.com/meghang-101/Ultrasonic-Repellent/blob/main/20-12-2020-10pm.brd) has the Eagle files for the Schematic and Board respectively.

The [Gerber Files](https://github.com/meghang-101/Ultrasonic-Repellent/blob/main/NewGerberFiles.zip) has the Gerber Files of the PCB which are necessary for manufacturing and fabrication.
